# notes on this project

* adding other vectorizers was kinda straightforward.
* adding interactivity is not, and more things could be parameterized. #futurework
* the shaders are in the index.html
    * the lod things make it more complicated, but looking at Point Vertex with size got me started
    * the texture tree is added from .js before compiling the shader
    * adding more info to the shader kinda possible, barebores there
* making it 3d should not be that much work(tm) #futurework
* in vertexshader take gl_PointSize*1.5 to scale gridview to filling proportions
